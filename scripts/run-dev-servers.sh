# This script starts Webpack's development server for React-bundles,
# and it starts Django's normal development server.
#
# It lets us (i.e. fabfile.py) run both of these processes in one
# shell, and more importantly lets us kill both processes together.
#
# Output from both development servers are intermixed in the same
# shell, so we try to keep it clean with a few filters. This might
# hide some error messages, so if things don't work, try to run
# Webpack and Django separately instead.
#
# If this script is run with 'serve' argument, the script will run
# both Webpack and Django on '0.0.0.0'. In order to coordinate
# Webpack and Django properly, it creates a new Webpack-config file
# which it should delete when the script ends.
